Memory suppression is central to affective disorders, but we still do not really know whether emotions, including their physiological causes, are also impacted by this process in normal functioning individuals. In two studies, we measured the after-effects of suppressing negative memories on cardiac response in healthy participants. Results of Study 1 revealed that efficient control of memories was associated with long-term inhibition of the cardiac deceleration that is normally induced by disgusting stimuli. Attempts to suppress sad memories, by contrast, aggravated the cardiac response, an effect that was closely related to the inability to forget this specific material. In Study 2, electroencephalography revealed a reduction in power in the theta (3–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz) and low-beta (13–20 Hz) bands during the suppression of unwanted memories, compared with their voluntary recall. Interestingly, however, the reduction of power in the theta frequency band during memory control was related to a subsequent inhibition of the cardiac response. These results provide a neurophysiological basis for the influence of memory control mechanisms on the cardiac system, opening up new avenues and questions for treating intrusive memories using motivated forgetting.","tags":[],"title":"Long-term modulation of cardiac activity induced by inhibitory control over emotional memories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Legrand","Sebastian Scott Engen","Camile Correa","Nanna Kildahl Mathiasen","Niia Nikolova","Francesca Fardo","Micah Allen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601317669,"objectID":"8ad750a633c7a288457b13b9bffdccc6","permalink":"https://legrandnico.github.io/publication/legrand-emotional-2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-28T18:27:49.277592Z","relpermalink":"/publication/legrand-emotional-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Emotion alters how we feel, see, and experience the world. In the domain of memory, the emotional valence and arousal of memorized stimuli can modulate both the acuity and content of episodic recall. However, no experiment has investigated whether arousal and valence also influence metacognition for memory (i.e., the process of self-monitoring memories). In a pre-registered study, we applied a novel psychophysiological design together with computational models of metacognition to assess the influence of stimulus valence and arousal on the sensitivity, bias, and efficiency of metamemory. To estimate the role of physiological arousal in mediating these effects, we recorded cardiac measures through pulse oximetry. We found that negative valence globally and substantially decreased both memory performance and subjective confidence, in particular for low-arousal words. Simultaneously, we found that emotional valence modulated both heart rate and heart-rate variability (HRV), indicating a robust effect of negative valence on physiological arousal during recognition memory. Exploratory trial-level analyses further revealed that subjective confidence was encoded in instantaneous heart-rate fluctuations, and that this relationship was modulated by emotional valence. Our results demonstrate that both recognition memory and metacognition are influenced by the emotional contents of encoded items and that this correlation is in part related to cardiac activity.","tags":[],"title":"Emotional Metacognition: Stimulus Valence Modulates Cardiac Arousal and Metamemory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Micah Allen","Nicolas Legrand","Camile Maria Costa Correa","Francesca Fardo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601317671,"objectID":"da32e8842b4274c413d2c44ea8973c4f","permalink":"https://legrandnico.github.io/publication/allen-thinking-2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-28T18:27:50.511221Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allen-thinking-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract The Bayesian brain hypothesis, as formalized by the free-energy principle, is ascendant in cognitive science.

Sleep favors the consolidation of both EB and TB intentions, but whether this benefit is preserved during ageing is still subject to debate. PM was assessed in 28 young and 27 older healthy volunteers using a virtual environment. Participants had to learn and execute intentions after intervals filled with either daytime wakefulness or nighttime sleep. Intentions consisted of four TB, four EB with a strong link between the cue triggering retrieval and the action to be performed (EB-link) and four with no link (EB-nolink). PM was not affected by age, whatever the type of intention and the nature of the retention interval. While sleep reinforced all types of intentions in young participants, this benefit was only observed for TB and EB-link intentions in older adults. Sleep also reinforced the intrinsic PM components in both groups. Thus, when assessed using complex realistic situations, PM is not impaired in ageing. Results are discussed in the light of memory schema theory and the possible impact of cognitive reserve on sleep and memory.","tags":[],"title":"Effects of Sleep and Age on Prospective Memory Consolidation: A Walk in a Virtual Museum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Legrand","Pierre Gagnepain","Denis Peschanski","Francis Eustache"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601317668,"objectID":"117f70eaa3ba2930b044e957bf2dfdbc","permalink":"https://legrandnico.github.io/publication/legrand-neurosciences-2015/","publishdate":"2020-09-28T18:27:48.025711Z","relpermalink":"/publication/legrand-neurosciences-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Neurosciences et mémoires collectives : les schémas entre cerveau, sociétés et cultures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Legrand","Fabian Guénolé","Francis Eustache","Géraldine Rauchs"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601317669,"objectID":"55698148fa0ab9d247db19e812aa0c60","permalink":"https://legrandnico.github.io/publication/legrand-reves-2015/","publishdate":"2020-09-28T18:27:48.638258Z","relpermalink":"/publication/legrand-reves-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Rêves et mémoire : revue de la littérature en neuropsychologie et neurosciences cognitives","type":"publication"}]
