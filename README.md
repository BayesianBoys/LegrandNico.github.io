This repository contain material for the advanced cognitive modeling course (Aarhus University). All Monday will be allocated to lectures, the practice and applications will be on Fridays. We will use Python (PyMC3 for Bayesian modelling, Tensorflow and OpenGym for deep reinforcement learning).

The portfolio will consist of 3 exercices in the form of Jupyter notebooks (weeks 11, 16 and 19).
